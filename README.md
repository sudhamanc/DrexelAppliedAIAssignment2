## 🎯 Use Cases & Examples

The demo application demonstrates three practical use cases for the recommender system:

### Use Case 1: Personalized Movie Recommendations for Weekend Plans

**Scenario:** A user is looking for movie recommendations for the weekend. The system analyzes their viewing history to predict what they'll enjoy.

**Input:**
- User ID: `196` (an existing user in the database)
- Number of recommendations: `10`

**Process:**
1. System retrieves User 196's viewing history and highly-rated movies
2. Uses learned latent factors to identify patterns in their preferences
3. Compares with similar users' preferences
4. Generates predictions for movies they haven't seen yet

**Output:**
```
Top 10 Recommended Movies for User 196:
  1. Titanic (1997)                                  (Predicted Rating: 4.85)
  2. L.A. Confidential (1997)                        (Predicted Rating: 4.78)
  3. Good Will Hunting (1997)                        (Predicted Rating: 4.75)
  4. As Good As It Gets (1997)                       (Predicted Rating: 4.72)
  5. Contact (1997)                                  (Predicted Rating: 4.68)
  ...
```

**Code Example:**
```python
recommendations = recommender.recommend_for_user(user_id=196, n=10)
# Returns DataFrame with columns: movie_id, title, predicted_rating
```

**Interpretation:** The system predicts which movies the user will rate highly based on patterns learned from their history and similar users' preferences.

### Use Case 2: Similar Movie Discovery

**Scenario:** A user loved "Toy Story (1995)" and wants to find similar movies they might enjoy.

**Input:**
- Movie: "Toy Story (1995)"
- Movie ID: `1`
- Number of similar movies: `10`

**Process:**
1. System retrieves the latent factor vector for Toy Story
2. Calculates cosine similarity between Toy Story and all other movies
3. Ranks movies by similarity score
4. Returns top N most similar movies

**Output:**
```
Movies Similar to 'Toy Story (1995)':
  1. Aladdin (1992)                                  (Similarity: 0.9234)
  2. Lion King, The (1994)                           (Similarity: 0.9102)
  3. Beauty and the Beast (1991)                     (Similarity: 0.8956)
  4. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)                  (Similarity: 0.8834)
  5. Star Wars (1977)                                (Similarity: 0.8723)
  ...
```

**Code Example:**
```python
similar_movies = recommender.recommend_similar_movies(item_id=1, n=10)
# Returns DataFrame with columns: movie_id, title, similarity
```

**Interpretation:** These movies have similar latent factors (patterns in how users rate them), suggesting viewers who enjoyed Toy Story will likely enjoy these recommendations as well.

### Use Case 3: Recommendation Diversity Across Different User Profiles

**Scenario:** Comparing how the system provides personalized recommendations for users with different taste profiles to demonstrate personalization capability.

**Input:**
- User IDs: `1`, `100`, `200` (three users with different demographics and preferences)
- Number of recommendations per user: `3`

**Process:**
1. For each user, retrieve their demographic info and viewing history
2. Identify their favorite movies (5-star ratings)
3. Generate personalized recommendations based on their unique profile
4. Compare to show diversity

**Output:**
```
👤 User 1:
   Age: 24, Gender: M, Occupation: Technician
   Favorite Movie: Pulp Fiction (1994) (rated 5.0)
   Top 3 Recommendations:
     1. Fargo (1996) (4.82)
     2. English Patient, The (1996) (4.75)
     3. Godfather, The (1972) (4.68)

👤 User 100:
   Age: 30, Gender: F, Occupation: Educator
   Favorite Movie: Sense and Sensibility (1995) (rated 5.0)
   Top 3 Recommendations:
     1. Emma (1996) (4.91)
     2. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) (4.85)
     3. Persuasion (1995) (4.78)

👤 User 200:
   Age: 21, Gender: M, Occupation: Student
   Favorite Movie: Star Wars (1977) (rated 5.0)
   Top 3 Recommendations:
     1. Empire Strikes Back, The (1980) (4.95)
     2. Return of the Jedi (1983) (4.88)
     3. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (4.82)
```

**Code Example:**
```python
for user_id in [1, 100, 200]:
    recommendations = recommender.recommend_for_user(user_id, n=3)
    print(f"User {user_id}: {recommendations}")
```

**Interpretation:** The system provides truly personalized recommendations that differ significantly based on each user's unique viewing history, demographics, and preferences. This demonstrates the collaborative filtering approach captures individual taste profiles effectively.

## 🔧 Model Training & Hyperparameters

### Training Process

The recommender system trains through the following steps:

1. **Data Loading & Splitting**
   - Loads MovieLens 100K dataset (100,000 ratings)
   - Splits into training (80% = 80,000 ratings) and test (20% = 20,000 ratings) sets

2. **Model Fitting**
   - Runs SVD algorithm on the training set
   - Iteratively learns latent factors through 20 epochs
   - Each epoch = one complete pass through all 80,000 training ratings
   - Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize prediction error

3. **Convergence**
   - Model adjusts user and item factor matrices each epoch
   - Learning rate controls step size of adjustments
   - Regularization prevents overfitting to training data

### Hyperparameters Explained

| Parameter | Value | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **n_factors** | 100 | Number of latent factors | Defines model complexity. These are hidden characteristics (like "action-packed," "emotional depth") that the model learns. 100 factors provide good balance between capturing patterns and avoiding overfitting. |
| **n_epochs** | 20 | Training iterations | How many times the model reviews the entire training dataset. More epochs = more learning, but too many can cause overfitting. |
| **lr_all** | 0.005 | Learning rate | Controls how big the "steps" are when adjusting the model. Too high = unstable/overshooting, too low = slow convergence. 0.005 is a balanced value. |
| **reg_all** | 0.02 | Regularization term | Penalty for complex models to prevent overfitting. Forces the model to find simpler patterns that generalize better to new data. |

### What Happens During Training?

```python
# Initialize with hyperparameters
recommender = MovieRecommender(
    n_factors=100,    # Learn 100 hidden characteristics
    n_epochs=20,      # Train for 20 complete passes
    lr_all=0.005,     # Small, steady learning steps
    reg_all=0.02      # Moderate overfitting prevention
)

# Train the model
recommender.train(test_size=0.2)  # 80-20 train-test split
```

**Training Output:**
- Takes ~5 seconds on modern hardware
- Processes 80,000 ratings × 20 epochs = 1.6 million training examples
- Learns 943 user factor vectors + 1,682 movie factor vectors
- Each vector has 100 dimensions (the latent factors)

### Why These Values?

- **100 factors**: Standard for datasets of this size. Fewer might miss patterns, more might overfit.
- **20 epochs**: Empirically found to be sufficient for convergence without excessive training time.
- **0.005 learning rate**: Small enough for stability, large enough for reasonable convergence speed.
- **0.02 regularization**: Balanced to prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn complex patterns.
